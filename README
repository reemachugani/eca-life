e-CA life==========This site is built with an intention of providing a platform for collaboration of a university's co-curricular life.Originally built with for Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, the site serves to be a place where freshmen can know more about the university's ECA life and discover their interests before they join clubs and committees.For the current students, the site serves to provide a means of communication among club members. It also facilitates event registration online with a simple REGISTER link that reduces the hassles of maintaining a seperate database of registered students while all the heavy-lifting is handled by the site.The site provides forums which allow students to voice their concerns and queries directly to the clubs. Private messaging and chat-rooms for individual clubs is also incorporated to provide a more cohesive communication and planning among club members.Clubs can make announcements and post events with viewability constraints, ie, a club might choose to make an event announcement only viewable to its members and not all students, etc.To avoid the site being spammed by unknown clubs or committees, any new club added is displayed to the users only when approved by the site-admin. Every club also has a club-admin, who can alone make announcements, post events, edit or delete them.As the clubs and number of events increase to a few hundreds, it'll be difficult for the users to view them. Keeping that mind, every user has the option of customizing and filtering the results that are displayed as per their areas of interest.Another feature that is included in the site is to help students easily locate the venue of the event. For many studnets, esp. freshmen it is difficult to find the different locations in the university. So, the site locates the venue of the event and displays it in the event page using university's map.===========
